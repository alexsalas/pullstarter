Pullstarter
===========

This is a collection of helpers (pullstarter.js) and example code
(bootstrap.js, etc.) for writing restartless Firefox add-ons without
resorting to Jetpack for automatic unloading. This is ideal for small
and nimble add-ons for which Jetpack would be unnecessary bloat.
