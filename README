Pullstarter
===========

This is a collection of helpers (pullstarter.js) and example code
(bootstrap.js, etc.) for writing restartless Firefox add-ons without
resorting to Jetpack for automatic unloading. This is ideal for small
and nimble add-ons for which Jetpack would be unnecessary bloat.

To start a new add-on, get a copy of this directory and simply fill in
the values for your add-on in the usual places:

* install.rdf
* bootstrap.js
* chrome.manifest (you may not need this)
* options.xul (you may not need this)
